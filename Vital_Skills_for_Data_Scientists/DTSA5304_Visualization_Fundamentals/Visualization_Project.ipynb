    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I have selected the \"Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset\" from Kaggle. Although the data is synthetic, I chose it because it includes a diverse set of variables and allows for the exploration of multiple relationships between them. The dataset contains key attributes such as occupation, sleep duration, and sleep quality, along with other well-being indicators like physical activity level, stress level, blood pressure, and sleep disorders.\n",
    "My objective is to explore the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does occupation influence sleep duration?\n",
    "- Is sleep quality correlated with stress levels?\n",
    "- Do sleep disorders impact both sleep duration and quality?\n",
    "- How do sleep duration and quality change over time? Is there a gender-based difference?\n",
    "- Does physical activity correlate with better sleep quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "While it would be ideal to analyze real-world data, I encountered challenges in finding a sufficiently updated dataset that included a wide range of relevant variables while remaining manageable in size. A comprehensive and up-to-date dataset on sleep health could significantly benefit sleep medicine research. At the same time, this structured dataset serves as a valuable methodological example for conducting an in-depth analysis in a real-world study."

    "Also, I analyzed a Kaggle notebook available at: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ratchakritbootkong/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset-analyze . The analysis demonstrates a strong use of the grammar of graphics, with well-structured visualizations that feature clear axes and minimal visual clutter.\n",
    "The study explores sleep duration by gender, followed by a line plot analyzing sleep duration across different age groups. An alternative approach could be to consolidate these insights into a single graph, using color to encode gender, which might offer a more comprehensive view.\n",
    "Additionally, the analysis examines the relationship between physical activity and sleep quality using a bar plot to display average values. While this effectively summarizes the data, a scatter plot could potentially reveal clusters or patterns that are not as apparent in a bar chart.\n",
    "One of the standout visualizations in the analysis is a correlation between age and sleep disorders, which is both clear and insightful. Another valuable visualization is a box plot showing the relationship between stress levels and sleep duration, which effectively captures distribution patterns and variations."

Secondary questions include: Are there any factors that directly correlate with poor sleep quality?\n",

We will evaluate the quantity, depth, and time to insights. which will help determine whether our visualization effectively communicates key findingd. Specifically, we aim to see whether relationships(or lack thereof) between sleep quality and health variables are clearly conveyed. Addiotionally, this evaluation will highlight potential areas for design improvement.\n",
